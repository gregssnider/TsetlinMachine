Installing cupy and configuring PyCharm (Anaconda)
--------------------------------------------------


1. Installing cupy

The basic directions can be found online, but there are problems with
environment variables. Steps:

(a) Find out where your CUDA libraries are and set CUDA_PATH to that.
PyTorch installs these for you, and not in the same place that NVIDIA's truly
awful installer does. For me, this was:

    CUDA_PATH=/home/greg/anaconda3/pkgs/cudatoolkit-8.0-3/lib/

(b) When installing cupy, it wants to know both the CUDA_PATH and the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This shell command does the trick for me:

    CUDA_PATH=/home/greg/anaconda3/pkgs/cudatoolkit-8.0-3/lib/ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/greg/anaconda3/pkgs/cudatoolkit-8.0-3/lib pip install cupy-cuda80 --no-cache-dir



2. PyCharm (hard way -- see 3. below)

PyCharm does not import environment variables from .bashrc or .profile, so
you need to configure LD_LIBRARY_PATH in PyCharm for cupy. A semi-painful
way to do this is to install a plugin named "EnvFile"

(a) Go to "File -> Settings -> Plugins" and install it.

(b) Create a file in the top of your project directory called, say,
environment.env and include the following in it:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/greg/anaconda3/pkgs/cudatoolkit-8.0-3/lib

(c) For your project run configurations, go to "Edit Configurions" and hit
the "EnvFile" tab, and hit the green "+" to add your "environment.env" file
that you created in the last step.



3. PyCharm (easy way)

To import environment variables into PyCharm unconditionally:

(a) Create a bash script that declares the variables before executing PyCharm.
For example, I created the script pycharm.sh in my home directory that contains:

    #! /bin/bash
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/greg/anaconda3/pkgs/cudatoolkit-8.0-3/lib /opt/pycharm-community-2018.1.1/bin/pycharm.sh

(b) Right click on desk top and hit Create Launcher.

(c) In the launcher, fill in the name (e.g. "PyCharm for cupy") and the command
(/home/greg/pycharm.sh).

(d) Put the launcher on the toolbar (drag and drop) and single click to launch.
